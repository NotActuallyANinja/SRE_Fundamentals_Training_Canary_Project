# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: - When I changed the values.yml file, the upgrades wouldn't get deployed by helm. I had to push my changes to github to be able to get helm to deploy the changes. This is why my version counter was higher than expected.
                        - When I deployed and rolled back my changes I had to reconfigure port 8081 each time to get the canary deployment online with the command "kubectl port-forward svc/canary-demo-canary 8081:80 -n canary-demo &"
                        - http_requests_total wasn't an available metric in graphana/prometheus for me. I tried to play around with settings to get this to work, or use an alternative metric but I couldn't find any way to resolve the issue.
